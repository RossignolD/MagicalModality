\chapter{Our first meeting all together}

\section{Introduction of myself}
My name is Mei Rose. 
My background in Formal Logic consists mostly of undergraduate courses in Philosophical Logic, but I studied Mathematical Logic at UW and 
at the Universiteit van Amsterdam, for two and one semester respectively. I worked at a software development group in my undergraduate university 
and wrote a proof-checker in JavaScript. Modal logic has been a passion of mine since taking a course on the Philosophy of Mathematics
and seeing its history and uses since the times of Leibniz and earlier to puzzle about statements about possible worlds. My personal 
logic and mathematics heroes of history are David Hilbert and Amalie Emmy Noether. In recent history, I have looked up to Saul Aaron Kripke, 
who died in 2022 and left a wave of controversy in his wake that we will hopefully have time to discuss during this project. And alive today, 
inspiring me to be a Logician, is J. F. A. K. (Johan) van Benthem, the only person I know of who holds permanent research positions 
at three different universities at the same time.

\section{Introductions of students}
I am interested to know how your journey through mathematics and logic has been going so far. 
All I know about you is that the committee recommended you into the project, what courses you are enrolled in, 
and which courses you have taken that are relevant to the reading group. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Please tell me about your favorite mathematical experiences. What made them special or unique?
    \item What sorts of things do you like to do outside of your coursework? Does mathematics or logic ever factor into those activities? 
    \item Who inspires you in history, or the present day?
\end{itemize}

\section{Overview and goals}
As stated in the project description, I aim for us to discuss many aspects of the so-called modal logic by the end of the semester. 
After establishing some groundwork in Kripke frames and models and a brief discussion of modal bisimulation, I plan to begin tackling 
the applications of modal logic. This is where your interests come in. I have the most experience working with modal logic 
applications in philosophy and linguistics, but there exist many more, such as information/preference theory, game theory, and more. 
Modal logic also touches more classical logic topics such as provability and model theory, and we can look into those if you are interested. 
(The ``magical'' [according to van Benthem] modal proof of Second Incompleteness is what gave this project its name.)

I would like to conclude the project with two connections between modal logic and first-order logic. 
These two connections are called van Benthem's Theorem and the Salqvist-van Benthem Algorithm. 
Each gives a slightly different viewpoint on how powerful modal logic is compared to first-order logic.

\section{Propositional and First-order logic reminders}

I will be assuming throughout this project that you are familiar with the following logical symbols from propositional logic: $\logicnot$ (logical negation,
sometimes written as $\neg$), $\wedge$ (logical conjunction), $\vee$ (logical disjunction), $\rightarrow$ (material conditional), and $\leftrightarrow$ 
(biconditional).This means that you know their truth tables, and how to “read” them in a formula (e.g., $P \wedge Q$
gets read as ``$P$ and $Q$''.)

As for the first-order logic I expect you to be familiar with, $\forall$ and $\exists$ are the starting point. 
Being able to read these symbols as ``for all'' and ``there exists/there is at least one'' is important, as is being able to write and interpret statements with
relation or function symbols like $R(x,y)$ or $F(x, y, z)$. When I say that R is a two-place relation between a 
set and itself (as most of our relations will be in this project), I want you to be able to picture a 
diagram like the one below. The arrows show the relations. For example, we can say that $R(z,x)$ or that $(z,x) \in R$.

\end{center}

We all have preferences for what symbols and variables we use as Logicians. 
For example, I prefer to call propositions $P$, $Q$, etc. and use the $\logicnot$ symbol for the logical negation. 
I will try to accommodate your preferences, but know that I will fall back on mine if I forget. 
Van Benthem notably believes, or at least states, that you should be able to change notation for these sorts 
of things as one changes clothes. 

Additionally, when we begin discussing things where the object language and the m
etalanguage become important distinctions, my preferred metalanguage symbols for 
the above-referenced propositional logic connectives are: NOT for the logical negation, AND for 
the logical conjunction, OR for the logical disjunction, ONLY IF for the material conditional, and IFF 
for the biconditional. These last two are unlikely to be seen much, but I thought that I should establish them. 
For the metalanguage universal quantifier (equivalent to $\forall$) I like to use symbol $\bigwedge$, and for the 
metalanguage existential quantifier (equivalent to $\exists$) I like to use $\bigvee$. These should be distinguished
from the object language $\wedge$ and $\vee$ that we will be using for the conjunction and disjunction, respectively.

\section{A few new things}

I mentioned above that there is a distinction between what is called the object language and the metalanguage. 
The object language is the (logical, though can be natural) language we are currently using. 
The majority of the time this will be the language of modal logic and its associated symbols. 
The metalanguage is the (same caveat) language we use to talk about the object language. 
A natural language example is the following, taken from A. Tarski: “Schnee ist weiss” if and only if snow is white. 
The object language, set off here in quotation marks, is German, and the metalanguage, 
left outside the quotation marks, is English. The philosophy people will notice that this is similar, 
but not quite the same, as the \emph{de dicto}/\emph{de re} distinction.

The distinction will come into play when we want to say things about modal logic, using the language of first-order logic. 
For example, when we define what it means for a formula of the form $\phi \wedge \psi$ to be satisfied in a possible world 
$\alpha$, we will make a statement like: ``''$\alpha \Vdash \phi \wedge \psi \IFF \alpha \Vdash \phi \AND \alpha \Vdash \psi$.''
The logical conjunction in the part of this sentence before (and not including) IFF is in the object 
language of modal logic. But the logical conjunction in the part of the sentence after (and including) IFF 
is in the metalanguage of first-order logic. Essentially, this allows us to talk about logic using logic, and keep clear when we are doing which. 
We need to be really careful about this distinction. Please prompt me if I am not being clear about when we 
are using the object language and when we are using the metalanguage.

\section{Before the next time we meet}
Please obtain the book Modal Logic for Open Minds by van Benthem. 
If you are able to get it before the next meeting, please read the first chapter, 
``A whirlwind history, and changes in perspective'' and the second chapter, ``Basic language and semantics''. 
Section 2.4 will be optional, but do feel free to read it and let me know if you want the project to look more closely at 
``game semantics'' like this. I recommend an attempt of Exercises 1(a), 1(b), 2(a), 3(a), and 3(b) 
to cement your understanding of the reading. We will discuss these during the next meeting. 
If you choose to read Section 2.4, Exercises 2(b) and 2(c) may help your understanding.
