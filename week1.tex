\chapter[Kripke frames and models]{Sing a song of Kripke: Kripke frames and models}

Two of the most fundamental objects of study in Modal Logic are Kripke frames and Kripke models, both named for Saul Aaron Kripke,
(1940--2022). My lecturer in Amsterdam, who taught me the mathematical foundations of the field of Modal Logic, always
said that there were two kinds of Modal Logicians: those who prefer to think in terms of Kripke frames, and those who prefer
to think in terms of Kripke models. I suppose that I am more of a Kripke model person myself, despite not really 
being a model theorist myself. You will see that the two objects roughly correspond to a syntactic (proof theoretic) and
semantic (model theoretic) position, respectively. I will leave that matter of taste to you.
