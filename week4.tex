\chapter[A taste of some applications of modal logic]{Speed--dating for applications of modal logic}

Modal logic finds its way into many fields of study, from philosophy to computer science, to mathematics,
and beyond. I will quickly summarise these applications. I will put an asterisk next
to sections on applications that I have personally seen. Please look at all of the
applications I present. I will let each of you choose an application that excites or
interests you.

Please let me know which of the applications you are interested in by Wednesday of the
week. That way, I can begin to plan and find resources if it is not covered in van
Benthem's book.
