\chapter[Presentation Preparations]{The Art of the Slidedeck: Explaining to others what you've been thinking about semester}
I think that 15 minutes to give everyone a basic idea of what a Kripke model is and how the Kripke semantics give us a meaning for the symbols
$P, \logicnot \phi, \phi \wedge \psi, \logicdiamond \phi$, and $\logicbox \phi$. Then, each of you can have 10 minutes to 
give some explanation of how Modal Logic comes into your chosen application from the last three weeks.

\section{Setting yourselves up for success}
By the next time we've met, I would like you to each write down an outline for your 10 minute section. We will build, rehearse,
and tweak your presentation at the next meeting. Have some ideas in mind for how you would like to highlight your chosen
application's main goals or purpose or just that \emph{je ne sais quoi} of the way that it changes your perspective on things.
